    <p>What happens when elements of game play meet the college experience?</p>

    <p>Just Press Play adds a game layer to our undergraduates’ daily life.  We invite students in RIT’s School of Interactive Games and Media to engage in a playful way with their educational environments and experiences.</p>

    <p>With the generous support of Microsoft Research Connections, we’re working to make the platform available to other educational institutions. </p>
